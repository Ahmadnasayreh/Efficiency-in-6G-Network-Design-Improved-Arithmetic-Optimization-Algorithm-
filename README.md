Novel Method Development: Proposed a new method, IBAOA, to enhance intrusion detection in 6G environments.
Feature Selection Optimization: Converted the Arithmetic Optimization Algorithm (AOA) from continuous to binary for effective feature selection.
Improved Algorithm Application: Applied an improved version of AOA, utilizing opposition-based learning (OBL) to initialize parameters, enhancing the solution to the feature selection problem.
